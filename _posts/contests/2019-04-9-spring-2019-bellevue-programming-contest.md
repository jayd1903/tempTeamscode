## About <u>Smart Coding School</u>:
Smart Coding School is a computer science education school established in March 2016. We develop computer science and engineering curriculums and offer courses for middle school and high school students (12 ~ 18 years old), and mainly provide Java Programming, data structures and algorithms, AP Computer Science A Test Prep and USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) training courses. On the 2017 Computer Science A AP Test, 95% of our students received 5 out of 5 scores. Many of our students successfully got into the Platinum, Gold, and Silver levels in USA Computing Olympiad competition. In local coding competitions, our students took 2nd place in the advanced division and 1st place in the intermediate division.
Smart Coding School is powered by passionate software engineers from local top hi-tech companies such as Amazon and Microsoft. We believe that early computer science education can make a big difference for students. Our passion is to inspire kids and teens to see things differently from engineering perspectives and to believe that they can make a big impact through technology. Smart Coding School is all about students and prepare students for the future with technology.
