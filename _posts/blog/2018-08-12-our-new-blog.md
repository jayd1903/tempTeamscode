Welcome to our first blog post! This is the place to find what TeamsCode members are working on -- from programming contests across the Pacific Northwest to online courses for computer science. For now, I'll list our current goals for the Fall of 2018:

- Create three programming contests, one in Washington, Oregon, and California
- Build new courses on our <a class="a" href="/learn">Learn</a> page.
- Partner with companies around the PNW to bring coding to more students.
- Build an online Slack community for high school students to discover computer science.

If you're curious about any of these initiatives, feel free to ask! Reach out to us at <a class="a" href="mailto:questions@teamscode.com">questions@teamscode.com</a>.

Stay tuned for more updates!
