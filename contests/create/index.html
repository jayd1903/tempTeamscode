        We encourage students passionate about hosting programming contests to join our team! We are always open to new, creative ideas that help expand our organization and foster a tight-knit community of coders. However, since organizing a contest takes a considerable time commitment, team members are expected to dedicate 30 minutes - 1 hour per day. Interested? Apply to our team now!
